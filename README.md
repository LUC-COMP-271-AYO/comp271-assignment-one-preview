# Comp 271 Assignment One: Search Algorithms

## Due date: November 4, 2023, 9:00am

### Step One - Fork the repository to your own GitHub space and clone your forked repository - 5 points

First, click the "Fork" button in the upper right-hand corner of the GitHub view.  This will
create a **fork** of this repository in your personal GitHub space.

Second, clone your forked repository.  **Do not clone the original repository!!**  Clone the repository
that you find in your personal space in GitHub.

### Step Two - Implement each sorting algorithm - 60 points

In class we have studied three sorting algorithms:
* Selection Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

You are given a partially-built Java application, with tests and code to run each of these three sorting 
algorithms.  Your first assignment is to complete the code to implement each algorithm.

### Step Three - Analyze the running time of each algorithm - 15 points

Now that you have code each algorithm, complete the following table by entering the running time
and memory requirements of each algorithm, *using Big-O notation*:

|   Algorithm    | Running time in Big-O notation | Memory required, also in Big-O notation |
|:--------------:|:------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| Selection Sort |        your answer here        |            your answer here             |
|   Quick Sort   |        you answer here         |            your answer here             |
|   Merge Sort   |        your answer here        |            your answer here             |
